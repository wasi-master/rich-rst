<span class="r1">╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝</span>
<span class="r3">The primary goal of </span><span class="r2">reStructuredText</span><span class="r3"> is to define a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation </span>
<span class="r3">domains, that is readable and simple, yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.  The intended purpose of the </span>
<span class="r3">reStructuredText markup is twofold:</span>

<span class="r4"> • </span>the establishment of a set of standard conventions allowing the expression of structure within plaintext, and
<span class="r4"> • </span>the conversion of such documents into useful structured data formats.
<span class="r3">The secondary goal of reStructuredText is to be accepted by the Python community (by way of being blessed by PythonLabs </span>
<span class="r3">and the BDFL ) as a standard for Python inline documentation (possibly one of several standards, to account for </span>
<span class="r3">taste).To clarify the primary goal, here are specific design goals, in order, beginning with the most important:</span>
<span class="r4"> 1</span> Readable.  The marked-up text must be easy to read without any prior knowledge of the markup language.  It should be 
easily read in raw form as in processed form.
<span class="r4"> 2</span> Unobtrusive.  The markup that is used should be as simple and unobtrusive as possible.  The simplicity of markup 
constructs should be roughly proportional to their frequency of use.  The most common constructs, with natural and 
obvious markup, should be the simplest and most unobtrusive.  Less common constructs, for which there is no natural or 
obvious markup, should be distinctive.
<span class="r4"> 3</span> Unambiguous.  The rules for markup must not be open for interpretation.  For any given input, there should be one and
only one possible output (including error output).
<span class="r4"> 4</span> Unsurprising.  Markup constructs should not cause unexpected output upon processing.  As a fallback, there must be a 
to prevent unwanted markup processing when a markup construct is used in a non-markup context (for example, when 
documenting the markup syntax itself).
<span class="r4"> 5</span> Intuitive.  Markup should be as obvious and easily remembered as possible, for the author as well as for the reader. 
Constructs should take their cues from such naturally occurring sources as plaintext email messages, newsgroup postings,
and text documentation such as README.txt files.
<span class="r4"> 6</span> Easy.  It should be easy to mark up text using any ordinary text editor.
<span class="r4"> 7</span> Scalable.  The markup should be applicable regardless of the length of the text.
<span class="r4"> 8</span> Powerful.  The markup should provide enough constructs to produce a reasonably rich structured document.
<span class="r4"> 9</span> Language-neutral.  The markup should apply to multiple natural (as well as artificial) languages, not only English.
<span class="r4"> 10</span> Extensible.  The markup should provide a simple syntax and interface for adding more complex general markup, and cus
markup.
<span class="r4"> 11</span> Output-format-neutral.  The markup will be appropriate for processing to multiple output formats, and will not be bi
toward any particular format.
<span class="r3">The design goals above were used as criteria for accepting or rejecting syntax, or selecting between alternatives.It is </span>
<span class="r3">emphatically </span><span class="r5">not</span><span class="r3"> the goal of reStructuredText to define docstring semantics, such as docstring contents or docstring </span>
<span class="r3">length. These issues are orthogonal to the markup syntax and beyond the scope of this specification.Also, it is not the </span>
<span class="r3">goal of reStructuredText to maintain compatibility with </span><span class="r2">StructuredText</span><span class="r3"> or </span><span class="r2">Setext</span><span class="r3">.  reStructuredText shamelessly steals </span>
<span class="r3">their great ideas and ignores the not-so-great.Author&#x27;s note:</span>
    <span class="r6">Due to the nature of the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve (or, perhaps, due to the nature of the proposed solution), </span>
<span class="r6">the above goals unavoidably conflict.  I have tried to extract and distill the wisdom accumulated over the years in the </span>
<span class="r6">Python Doc-SIG mailing list and elsewhere, to come up with a coherent and consistent set of syntax rules, and the above </span>
<span class="r6">goals by which to measure them.</span>

<span class="r1">╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝</span>
<span class="r2">reStructuredText</span><span class="r3">, the specification, is based on </span><span class="r2">StructuredText</span><span class="r3"> and </span><span class="r2">Setext</span><span class="r3">.  StructuredText was developed by Jim Fulton </span>
<span class="r3">of </span><span class="r2">Zope Corporation</span><span class="r3"> (formerly Digital Creations) and first released in 1996. It is now released as a part of the </span>
<span class="r3">open-source &quot;Z Object Publishing Environment&quot; (</span><a class="r2" href="https://www.zope.dev">ZOPE</a><span class="r3">).  Ian Feldman&#x27;s and Tony Sanders&#x27; earlier </span><span class="r2">Setext</span><span class="r3"> specification was </span>
<span class="r3">either an influence on StructuredText or, by their similarities, at least evidence of the correctness of this approach.</span>

<span class="r3">I discovered </span><span class="r2">StructuredText</span><span class="r3"> in late 1999 while searching for a way to document the Python modules in one of my projects.</span>
<span class="r3">Version 1.1 of StructuredText was included in Daniel Larsson&#x27;s </span><a class="r2" href="http://starship.python.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/">pythondoc</a><span class="r3">.  Although I was not able to get pythondoc to </span>
<span class="r3">work for me, I found StructuredText to be almost ideal for my needs.  I joined the Python </span><span class="r2">Doc-SIG</span><span class="r3"> (Documentation Special</span>
<span class="r3">Interest Group) mailing list and found an ongoing discussion of the shortcomings of the StructuredText &quot;standard&quot;.  This</span>
<span class="r3">discussion has been going on since the inception of the mailing list in 1996, and possibly predates it.</span>

<span class="r3">I decided to modify the original module with my own extensions and some suggested by the Doc-SIG members.  I soon </span>
<span class="r3">realized that the module was not written with extension in mind, so I embarked upon a general reworking, including </span>
<span class="r3">adapting it to the &quot;re&quot; regular expression module (the original inspiration for the name of this project).  Soon after I</span>
<span class="r3">completed the modifications, I discovered that StructuredText.py was up to version 1.23 in the ZOPE distribution. </span>
<span class="r3">Implementing the new syntax extensions from version 1.23 proved to be an exercise in frustration, as the complexity of </span>
<span class="r3">the module had become overwhelming.</span>

<span class="r3">In 2000, development on StructuredTextNG (&quot;Next Generation&quot;) began at </span><a class="r2" href="http://www.zope.com">Zope Corporation</a><span class="r3"> (then Digital Creations).  It </span>
<span class="r3">seems to have many improvements, but still suffers from many of the problems of classic StructuredText.</span>

<span class="r3">I decided that a complete rewrite was in order, and even started a </span><a class="r2" href="http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/">reStructuredText SourceForge project</a><span class="r3"> (now inactive). </span>
<span class="r3">My motivations (the &quot;itches&quot; I aim to &quot;scratch&quot;) are as follows:</span>

<span class="r4"> • </span>I need a standard format for inline documentation of the programs I write.  This inline documentation has to be 
convertible to other useful formats, such as HTML.  I believe many others have the same need.
<span class="r4"> • </span>I believe in the Setext/StructuredText idea and want to help formalize the standard.  However, I feel the current 
specifications and implementations have flaws that desperately need fixing.
<span class="r4"> • </span>reStructuredText could form part of the foundation for a documentation extraction and processing system, greatly 
benefitting Python.  But it is only a part, not the whole.  reStructuredText is a markup language specification and a 
reference parser implementation, but it does not aspire to be the entire system.  I don&#x27;t want reStructuredText or a 
hypothetical Python documentation processor to die stillborn because of over-ambition.
<span class="r4"> • </span>Most of all, I want to help ease the documentation chore, the bane of many a programmer.
<span class="r3">Unfortunately I was sidetracked and stopped working on this project. In November 2000 I made the time to enumerate the </span>
<span class="r3">problems of StructuredText and possible solutions, and complete the first draft of a specification.  This first draft </span>
<span class="r3">was posted to the Doc-SIG in three parts:</span>
<span class="r4"> • </span>A Plan for Structured Text
<span class="r4"> • </span>Problems With StructuredText
<span class="r4"> • </span>reStructuredText: Revised Structured Text Specification
<span class="r3">In March 2001 a flurry of activity on the Doc-SIG spurred me to further revise and refine my specification, the result </span>
<span class="r3">of which you are now reading.  An offshoot of the reStructuredText project has been the realization that a single markup</span>
<span class="r3">scheme, no matter how well thought out, may not be enough.  In order to tame the endless debates on Doc-SIG, a flexible </span>
<a class="r2" href="../../peps/pep-0256.html">Docstring Processing System framework</a><span class="r3"> needed to be constructed.  This framework has become the more important of the two</span>
<span class="r3">projects; </span><span class="r2">reStructuredText</span><span class="r3"> has found its place as one possible choice for a single component of the larger framework.The</span>
<span class="r3">project web site and the first project release were rolled out in June 2001, including posting the second draft of the </span>
<span class="r3">spec  and the first draft of PEPs 256, 257, and 258  to the Doc-SIG.  These documents and the project implementation </span>
<span class="r3">proceeded to evolve at a rapid pace.  Implementation history details can be found in the </span><a class="r2" href="../../../HISTORY.html">project history file</a><span class="r3">.In </span>
<span class="r3">November 2001, the reStructuredText parser was nearing completion. Development of the parser continued with the addition</span>
<span class="r3">of small convenience features, improvements to the syntax, the filling in of gaps, and bug fixes.  After a long holiday </span>
<span class="r3">break, in early 2002 most development moved over to the other Docutils components, the &quot;Readers&quot;, &quot;Writers&quot;, and </span>
<span class="r3">&quot;Transforms&quot;.  A &quot;standalone&quot; reader (processes standalone text file documents) was completed in February, and a basic </span>
<span class="r3">HTML writer (producing HTML 4.01, using CSS-1) was completed in early March.</span><a class="r2" href="../../peps/pep-0287.html">PEP 287</a><span class="r3">, &quot;reStructuredText Standard </span>
<span class="r3">Docstring Format&quot;, was created to formally propose reStructuredText as a standard format for Python docstrings, PEPs, </span>
<span class="r3">and other files.  It was first posted to </span><a class="r2" href="news:comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a><span class="r3"> and the </span><a class="r2" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/">Python-dev</a><span class="r3"> mailing list on 2002-04-02.Version 0.4 of </span>
<span class="r3">the </span><span class="r2">reStructuredText</span><span class="r3"> and </span><a class="r2" href="http://docstring.sourceforge.net/">Docstring Processing System</a><span class="r3"> projects were released in April 2002.  The two projects were </span>
<span class="r3">immediately merged, renamed to &quot;</span><span class="r2">Docutils</span><span class="r3">&quot;, and a 0.1 release soon followed.</span>
